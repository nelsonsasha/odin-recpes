        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>½ stick butter </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>½ cup white wine </li>
            <li>3 lemons, juiced </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons drained capers </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Directions (Steps)</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces. Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thin. Place flour on a plate and dredge each breast on both sides in flour.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Put chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and season again. Cook second side until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.</li>
            <li>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, about 5 minutes more. Add capers and pour sauce over chicken breasts on the plate. Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
